## Abstract

The objective of the research is to analyse luxury hotel pictures posted online in social
media by the tourists to understand the different hotel attributes (bedroom, living
room, dinner room, restaurant etc.,) influencing the consumer evaluation of luxury hotel
brands.
</br>
</br>
Users seek out hotel photos before making a decision to book. The research evaluates
consumers’ visual data on TripAdvisor through a deep learning approach. Four different
deep CNN architectures were trained and compared, of which EfficientNet B4
performed the best, hence was used to classify the images in actual dataset.
</br>
</br>
Results shed light on the significant part of non-textual elements of the hotel
experience such as pictures, which cannot be explored through traditional methods. In
particular, the analysis of 9,251 consumers’ pictures leads to the identification of the
attributes that had the higher impact on their experience. These attributes emerged as
specific features of interior elements of the hotels (restaurant, bedroom and bathroom).
</br>
</br>
Finally, the study shows how deep learning algorithms can -
</br>
● help monitoring social media and understand consumers perception of luxury
hotels through the new analysis of visual data, and
</br>
● turn into better brand management strategies for luxury hotel managers
